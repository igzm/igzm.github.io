## What Are Music NFTs and Why Are They Valuable?

### Defining Music NFTs  
A **music NFT** (Non-Fungible Token) represents digital ownership of a musical work, whether it's a beat, audio file, or album. Unlike traditional music ownership, NFTs use blockchain technology to verify authenticity and scarcity.  

### Key Value Drivers

2. **Royalty Rights**: Owners can earn passive income through streaming royalties or resale profits.  
3. **Exclusivity**: Artists offer unique experiences, such as backstage passes or unreleased tracks, to NFT holders.  

**Example**: Electronic producer 3LAU sold his NFT album "Ultraviolet" for $11.6 million, combining rare tracks with real-world perks.  

### FAQ: Understanding Music NFTs  
**Q: Can I use a music NFT commercially?**  
A: Yes, if the smart contract grants usage rights. Always verify terms before purchase.  

**Q: How do artists benefit from NFTs?**  
A: NFTs allow artists to monetize directly, bypassing traditional labels, and earn royalties on secondary sales.
