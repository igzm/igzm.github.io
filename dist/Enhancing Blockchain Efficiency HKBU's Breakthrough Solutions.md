# Enhancing Blockchain Efficiency: HKBU's Breakthrough Solutions

## Hong Kong's Pioneering Role in Blockchain Innovation

Hong Kong has emerged as a trailblazer in blockchain adoption, launching Asia's first Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in late April. This milestone positions the city as a hub for virtual asset innovation while highlighting the growing importance of blockchain efficiency in modern financial infrastructure. As blockchain applications expand beyond cryptocurrency into critical sectors like healthcare and supply chain management, researchers face urgent challenges in optimizing this transformative technology.

## The Dual Challenges of Blockchain Technology

While blockchain's decentralized architecture offers unparalleled data security and transaction transparency, two major limitations persist:

1. **Energy-intensive operations** contributing to environmental concerns
2. **High storage costs** due to blockchain's immutable ledger structure

Current practices often store transaction metadata "off-chain" in external databases to mitigate costs, but this creates new vulnerabilities in data integrity verification. This dichotomy between cost efficiency and security has driven HKBU's computer science department to develop groundbreaking solutions.
