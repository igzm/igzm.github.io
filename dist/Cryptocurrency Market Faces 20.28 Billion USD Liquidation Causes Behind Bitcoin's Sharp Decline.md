# Cryptocurrency Market Faces 20.28 Billion USD Liquidation: Causes Behind Bitcoin's Sharp Decline

## Market Overview: Massive Liquidation and Bitcoin's Turbulence

The cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility in early February 2025, with Bitcoin briefly dropping below $92,000 and triggering **$20.28 billion in total liquidations** within 24 hours. This included **$17.66 billion in long positions** and **$2.7 billion in short positions**, impacting **700,594 traders** globally. Notably, a single ETH/USDT contract on Binance accounted for a **$25.6 million liquidation**. This market correction follows Bitcoin's pattern of abrupt declines since the Chinese New Year holiday, prompting investors to scrutinize underlying factors.

## Key Factors Driving Bitcoin's Decline

### 1. DeepSeek's Disruption of the AI Industry

On January 27, 2025, the AI model **DeepSeek** surpassed ChatGPT in U.S. App Store downloads, sparking global discussions about its implications. Unlike traditional AI models requiring billions in investment, DeepSeek achieved comparable performance with a **$6 million training budget**, challenging the industry's "scale equals success" paradigm. This disruption sent shockwaves through financial markets:

- **NVIDIA shares fell 5.3%**
- **Nasdaq Composite dropped over 400 points**
- **Bitcoin declined 4.4%**
- **Ethereum lost 3.8%**

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood highlighted DeepSeek's potential to accelerate cost reductions in AI development. However, U.S. officials raised national security concerns, with Trump initially praising the innovation before investigations began.

### FAQ: How does AI innovation affect cryptocurrency markets?
AI advancements like DeepSeek create cross-sector volatility. Investors often reallocate funds between high-tech sectors, causing correlated price movements between AI-related stocks and cryptocurrencies as both represent "future technology" investments.

### 2. Trump's Escalating Tariff Policies

The Trump administration implemented significant trade policy changes in early February 2025:

| Date       | Tariff Action                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feb 2      | 25% tariffs on Canadian/Mexican imports, 10% on Canadian energy resources     |
| Feb 1      | 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports                                     |
| Feb 3      | Announcement of pending EU tariffs due to trade deficit concerns              |

These measures reignited fears of **trade wars** and **stagflation**, pushing Bitcoin to two-week lows near **$91,000**. BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler noted increased risk aversion among traders, while Bitwise strategist Jeff Park predicted long-term benefits from potential dollar weakness.

### FAQ: Why do tariffs impact Bitcoin prices?
Tariffs influence currency values, inflation expectations, and global economic growth projections. Bitcoin often correlates with risk-on/risk-off investor behavior, making it sensitive to macroeconomic policy shifts.

### 3. El Salvador's Bitcoin Policy Reversal

On February 2, 2025, El Salvador's legislature passed amendments removing Bitcoin's status as legal tender:

- **Mandatory Bitcoin acceptance by merchants eliminated**
- **Government no longer accepts Bitcoin for tax payments**
- **Private transactions remain voluntary**

This reversal followed IMF pressure tied to a **$1.4 billion loan agreement**. Despite policy changes, President Bukele's administration continues accumulating Bitcoin, adding **5 BTC ($509,000)** on February 1, 2025, bringing total reserves to **6,055.18 BTC** ($618 million).

### FAQ: Does El Salvador's policy change spell failure for Bitcoin?
While the legal tender experiment concluded, grassroots adoption persists. Over 6,000 Bitcoin ATMs remain operational, and the government plans to install **Bitcoin nodes in every household**, indicating ongoing institutional support.
