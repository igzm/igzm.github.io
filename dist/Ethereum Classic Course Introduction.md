## üìö Course Structure Overview  

The Ethereum Classic Course is divided into four interconnected modules, each designed to build foundational knowledge while addressing real-world applications.  

### 1. Historical Foundations  
Explore the origins of blockchain technology, from public-key cryptography to the Cypherpunk movement. Key topics include:  
- **Public-key cryptography**: The mathematical backbone of blockchain security.  
- **The rise of Bitcoin**: How Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs vision redefined trustless systems.  
- **Ethereum‚Äôs split**: Why ETC emerged as the original Ethereum chain and its philosophical commitment to immutability.  

### 2. Technical Mechanics  
Dive into ETC‚Äôs operational framework:  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: How mining secures the network and prevents tampering.  
- **Smart contracts**: Self-executing agreements coded into the blockchain.  
- **Wallets and keys**: Understand private keys, public keys, and address generation.  

### 3. Industry Organization  
Analyze ETC‚Äôs role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem:  
- **Native vs. tokenized assets**: ETC‚Äôs status as a programmable "digital gold."  
- **Stablecoins and DeFi**: How ETC integrates with financial protocols.  
- **Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**: Trading mechanisms on blockchain layers.  

### 4. Future Trends  
Speculate on ETC‚Äôs evolution:  
- **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**: Tokenizing unique digital and physical assets.  
- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**: Governance models for community-driven projects.  
- **Smart legal contracts**: Enforcing agreements on immutable ledgers.

## üß† FAQs: Addressing Common Questions  

### **Q1: What is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?**  
ETC is the original Ethereum blockchain, preserved after a 2016 hard fork. It prioritizes immutability and PoW security, making it a reliable platform for dApps and decentralized systems.  

### **Q2: How is the ETC Course Structured?**  
The course is divided into four modules: History, Technical Mechanics, Industry Organization, and Future Trends. Each module includes video lessons (5‚Äì15 minutes) and supplementary articles.  

### **Q3: What Makes Proof-of-Work (PoW) Unique?**  
PoW secures networks through computational effort, making attacks prohibitively expensive. ETC‚Äôs commitment to PoW ensures long-term security and decentralization.  

### **Q4: Can ETC Support Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?**  
Yes. ETC hosts DeFi protocols like DEXs and lending platforms, leveraging its secure infrastructure for financial innovation.  

### **Q5: How Do I Access the Course Materials?**  
All videos are available on the Ethereum Classic Update YouTube playlist, while articles are hosted on the Ethereum Classic community site.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive: How ETC Works  

### **Proof-of-Work Security Model**  
ETC‚Äôs PoW consensus relies on miners solving cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions. This process, known as mining, secures the network by requiring immense computational resources to alter the blockchain.  

#### PoW vs. PoS: A Comparative Table  
| Feature                | Proof-of-Work (PoW)          | Proof-of-Stake (PoS)         |  
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Security Basis         | Computational effort         | Token holdings               |  
| Energy Consumption     | High                         | Lower                        |  
| Decentralization       | Proven, physical layer       | Centralization risks         |  
| Attack Resistance      | High (via mining costs)      | Vulnerable to "nothing at stake"|  

### **Smart Contracts and dApps**  
ETC‚Äôs Turing-complete virtual machine enables developers to deploy self-executing contracts. These contracts power dApps like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT marketplaces.
