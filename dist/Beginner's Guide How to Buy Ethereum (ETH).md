To buy Ethereum, investors typically use cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, or peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. Reputable centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Coinbase offer user-friendly interfaces for beginners. For enhanced security, hardware wallets such as Ledger or software wallets like MetaMask are recommended for storage.
