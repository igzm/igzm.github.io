## Understanding Stablecoins: Key Concepts

Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by anchoring their price to external assets. This stability addresses the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, making stablecoins ideal for:

- **Trading pairs on crypto exchanges**
- **DeFi protocols (lending, borrowing, yield farming)**
- **Cross-border remittances**
- **Store of value in high-inflation economies**

The market categorizes stablecoins into four primary models:
1. **Fiat-collateralized** (e.g., USDT, USDC)
2. **Crypto-collateralized** (e.g., DAI)
3. **Algorithmic** (e.g., FRAX)
4. **Hybrid systems**
