## Introduction  

As the blockchain industry evolves, Real World Assets (RWA) have emerged as a transformative force in financial technology. Projects like Realio Network are pioneering efforts to democratize access to tokenized physical assets.

## Understanding Real World Assets (RWA)  

**Real World Assets (RWA)** represent physical assets digitized through blockchain technology. This process, called **tokenization**, converts tangible assets like real estate, precious metals, or private equity into tradable digital tokens. These tokens serve as **proof of ownership**, enabling faster transactions and fractional ownership.  

### Key Advantages of RWA Tokenization  
1. **Liquidity Enhancement**: Illiquid assets (e.g., commercial real estate) become tradable within minutes.  
2. **Fractional Ownership**: High-value assets become accessible to smaller investors.  
3. **Transparency**: Immutable blockchain records ensure asset traceability.
