## Risk Considerations  
While the technical outlook is bullish, traders should monitor:  
- **Volume Spikes**: Sudden surges above $25B daily trading volume could accelerate gains.

- **Market Correlation**: DOGEâ€™s 0.85 correlation with Bitcoin means BTC volatility could impact price action.  

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is $0.1490 a critical support level?**  
A: This level has consistently reversed price drops since March 2025. A break below it would invalidate the current bullish thesis.  

**Q: How reliable are Bollinger Bands in crypto trading?**  
A: Theyâ€™re highly effective in volatile markets like crypto, as they adapt to price swings and highlight overbought/oversold conditions.  

**Q: What triggers DOGEâ€™s next rally?**
